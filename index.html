        <h2>Reunion Tower History</h2>
        <p> Tower, also known locally as "The Ball," was completed on February 2, 1978, along with the Hyatt Regency Dallas at Reunion, as part of an urban redevelopment project that also renovated the historic Union Station, which today services Amtrak, Dallas Area Rapid Transit, and the Trinity Railway Express to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Fort Worth. </p><br>
        <p>Henry C Beck Company was the tower's Prime contractor. Also see HCB Contractors and The Beck Group. Reunion Tower marks 35 years as Dallas landmark.</p><br>
        <p>When it first opened, the tower included radio station KOAX-FM, now KRLD-FM 105.3 FM, once owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting ("Live twenty-four hours a day from five-hundred feet above the city"). Because it is not used as a broadcast tower, it is not listed in the FCC Database.</p><br>
        <p>Reunion Tower reopened its restaurant level on February 9, 2009, after it was closed for major renovations on November 16, 2007. The observation deck reopened October 5, 2013, just in time for the Tower's 35th anniversary.</p>
        <p>The tower is located about 1,000 feet from Dealey Plaza and the site of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p>
